# Advent of Code

Contains my code for [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

## Project Structure

Each year has its own directory (i.e. `2024/`) with its own README.md explaining the technology used and any further information.

## Caution

Try to not use these solutions to cheat in Advent Of Code.
Feel free to use them as inspiration though if you get stuck!

From the official FAQ:

> Please try to avoid giving away the solution while people are competing. If a puzzle's global daily leaderboard isn't
> full yet, and you're likely to get points, please wait to stream/post your solution until after that leaderboard is
> full.
